      <p>Across the past two years I have been lucky enough to have work of mine published on a range of online and print outlets.</p>
      <p>My first regular gig with a major news outlet came in 2015 when I began writing Wellington club rugby reports for the <i><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/sport/91111937/northern-united-roll-wellington-at-hataitai-park-in-swindale-shield">Dominion Post</a></i>.</p>
      <p>Still, to this day, I am writing the same segment for the <i><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/sport/91111937/northern-united-roll-wellington-at-hataitai-park-in-swindale-shield">Dominion Post</a></i> on a weekly basis between March and August, while keeping busy with a range of other works.</p>
      <p>The now-defunct <i><a href="https://twitter.com/NZ_hoops">NZhoops</a></i> website was my next calling. During my time there I reported on the New Zealand National Basketball League, mainly the Wellington Saints, as well as crafting a weekly wrap-up of Kiwi basketballers' performances in Europe.</p>
      <p>That led to a position of Wellington Saints reporter for the <i><a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/basketball/news/article.cfm?c_id=21&objectid=11830163">New Zealand Herald</a></i> in 2017 which entails me attending Saints games as accredited media, interviewing relevant parties during the post-match and writing match reports.</p>
      <p>Other roles which I am currently a part of include weekly gambling analysis of the A-League for global football betting agency <i><a href="http://www.cubegoal.com/info/person/990601">CubeGoal</a></i>, as well as being a weekly contributor to <i><a href="http://www.clubrugby.co.nz/wellington/clubs-teams-people.php?author_id=7717">ClubRugby.co.nz</a></i>, writing <a href="http://www.clubrugby.co.nz/wellington/story.php?id=1634&page=2&sort=%60date%60+DESC&searchfield=&searchstring=">feature articles</a>, <a href="http://www.clubrugby.co.nz/wellington/story.php?id=1634&page=2&sort=%60date%60+DESC&searchfield=&searchstring=">opinion pieces</a> and <a href="http://www.clubrugby.co.nz/wellington/story.php?id=2068&page=1&sort=%60date%60+DESC&searchfield=&searchstring=">match reports</a>.</p>
      <p>In future I will continue to write for my current employers, though when I graduate from university in November I will be looking for a full-time job. If that doesn't come about, I will likely look at doing Massey University's journalism postgraduate course.</p>
