      <p><h2><i>Super Rugby round 7: Team, try and player of the week</i></h2></p><br>
      <p><h3>TEAM OF THE WEEK: HIGHLANDERS</h3></p>
      <p>The Highlanders were very disorganised in the first half as they conceded 9 penalties.  They missed a lot of tackles and got a spanking in possession with just 35% against the Blues in the first half.</p>  <p>They trailed at halftime 20-13 but in the second half, they bounced back.</p> <p>As I said last week that Aaron Smith is starting to get back to his best form and he was in this game. He was back to his old self again in what he does best on the field, which all New Zealand rugby fans will be very happy to see.</p> Richard Buckman was excellent in the midfield again, especially on defence. He made important tackles and was everywhere in the breakdown making those turnovers.</p> Ben Smith was at his best for the millionth time.  He scored a try and both of his attack and defence were excellent displays.</p> <p>Replacement loose forward Liam Squire made a huge impression coming off the bench.  He made his tackles, beat tackles and made some aggressive runs.</p><br>

      <p><h3>TRY OF THE WEEK: TONI PULU</h3></p>

      <p>This has got to be one of the best tries I've ever seen in my life.</p> <p>It all started when Stormers first five Robert du Preez kicked down to inside the Chiefs' 22 for enemy territory.  Chiefs fullback Damian McKenzie gathered the ball, did a sidestep on the Stormers defender and threw the pass to winger James Lowe.</p> <p>It then went back to McKenzie who made a storming run and threw a beautiful offload back to Lowe who made a good run and threw the pass away to centre Anton Lienert-Brown, who threw a lovely ball to flanker Liam Messam.</p> <p>Messam ran into the Stormers' 22, threw the ball away to Lowe once more then back to Messam almost inside the Stormers' 5m line and then he threw a basketball pass to the try-scorer Toni Pulu.</p> <p>What a try! That was awesome teamwork by the Chiefs!</p>
      <br>

      <p><h3>PLAYER OF THE WEEK: JAMES LOWE</h3></p>

      <p>Despite being involved in a Chiefs losing effort against the Stormers 34-26, winger James Lowe was outstanding. He was involved in an unbelievable 90m try to other Chiefs winger Toni Pulu, made strong runs and threw slick offloads.</p> <p>He also showed his abilities to make strong runs with 123 metres in 16 carries, beat 5 defenders, made 4 line breaks, threw 3 slick offloads.</p> <p>He scored a try and made some powerful kicks down field into enemy territory. He has a massive boot on him.</p> <p>Next season Lowe will be a massive loss as he heads off to Ireland to play for club Leinster at the end of the season. If he had stayed in New Zealand, he might have been a bolter into the All Blacks for the end of year tour because he is a very good player and such a smart decision maker.</p><br><br>
